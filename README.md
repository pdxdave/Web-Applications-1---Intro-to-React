Web Applications 1 - Intro to React

#### What is React?
React is a UI component library

#### Why was it made?
* It was built to deal with state.  For instance, the posts on Facebook represents a lot of data to deal with.    
* How to deal with all the data w/o bogging down the browser?
* Data is now component based and scalable. 
* It is NOT a framework.

* We use JSX to write React components. It's sort of a templating style language to write markup and Javascript
